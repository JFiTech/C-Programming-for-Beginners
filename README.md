# C Programming for Beginners Udemy Course

Sometime around late November of 2022 I started a C programming course on the online learning platform Udemy, it was called [C Programming for Beginners - Master the C Language](https://www.udemy.com/course/c-programming-for-beginners-/). It took me about 6 months to go through the whole course and I learned a lot of concepts that weren't even taught in my Computer Science classes at university.

My workflow was: start watching a video and listen, pause if I needed to take note of something important and/or take screenshots, write and run code if it was needed. Then solve the assigned challenges without looking at the solution until I had tried my hardest.

I decided to Open Source my notes from the course because I realized they were pretty beefy and it could help other people like me in their learning path, they are stored inside of [this repository on GitHub](https://github.com/JFiTech/C-Programming-for-Beginners).

I created the original file with the [Cherrytree](https://www.giuspen.net/cherrytree/) note taking application, it has a **.ctd** extension, you will have to install the previously stated program in order to view the file, there is also a PDF file that was included to make it easier for some people so you don't have to install Cherrytree on your machine.

The contents of the repository are the following:
- Code: for learning syntax and trying to solve challenges.
- Notes: Cherrytree document and PDF file.

I would like to emphasize on the fact that learning C is not just for someone who wants to focus their career on this programming language, knowing some 'low level' concepts related to C will make you a much better programmer at other High Level Languages because you will know what's going on 'under the hood' inside the computer, so my notes are intended to help most programmers out there.

Currently I am taking [Advanced C Programming](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-c-programming-course/) and will post the notes from that course as soon as I am done with it.

There will be some typos, mistakes and code that doesn't compile, but this is due to the fact that they are personal notes, I was learning and initially didn't intend to make this open source, otherwise I would have formatted it in a much nicer way.

Disclaimer: I am in no way affiliated with the creators of the course, nor the learning platform. I took the course, really liked it, learned a ton and wanted to share some content with other fellow learners.
